Setting the LD random seed to 2948695366

NOTE 1 [file topol.top, line 46959]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -0.003000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  


Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 298.15 K
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 46959]:
  The bond in molecule-type system1 between atoms 216 CD and 217 OE1 has an
  estimated oscillational period of 2.2e-02 ps, which is less than 10 times
  the time step of 4.0e-03 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

Warning: file does not end with a newline, last line:

gcq#411: "You see it through a charmed medium: you can not discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scale bark." (Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte)
