This directory contains dataframes for each existing dataset as well as a jupyter notebook that was used to construct the master dataframe,
"master_FEP.pkl". This contains information on the identity, score, and project/run for each v1/v2/v3 for each ligand of each dataset.
To access this information, use:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_pickle('master_FEP.pkl')

You can access/print a certain subset of this by any of the columns, so let's list columns with:
df.columns

Then you can look at all of the 'MS0323' dataset with:
df.loc[df.dataset.str.contains('MS0323')]

or just the RL systems of the '387' dataset with:
df.loc[df['dataset'] == '387_RL']

if you want to iterate over rows that match your selection do:
for index, row in master.loc[master['dataset'] == '72_RL'].iterrows():
    print(f"cp p{row['v1_project']}/RUN{row['v1_run']} p{row['v2_project']}/RUN{row['v2_run']}")

you can pair multiple selections together in a similar loop:
for index, row in master.loc[(master['dataset'] == '72_RL') & (df['run'] < 100)].iterrows():
    print(row)

if you have other questions or suggestions to add here, ask Matt!
