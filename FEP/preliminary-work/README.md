## Description 

This directory contains some examples of FEP simulations worked up in preparation of
FEP simulations readied for production on FAH:

### 100_ligands
```
100_ligands                  -- the 100 test ligands from Tim Dudgeon, prepared OpenMM --> gmx 5.0.4 by Matt
100_ligands_FEPready         -- FEP-ready projects 

100_ligands_noreceptor       -- the 100 test ligands, alone in a small box of solvent
100_ligands_noreceptor_FEPready   -- FEP-ready versions
```

### 7_hits
```
7_hits                       -- 7 fragment hits from the DiamondMX team, send to us my Tim Dudgeon
7_hits_FEPready
```

### MDM2-4LWU receptor-ligand system

```
MDM2-4LWU-receptor-ligand    -- a nutlin-like small molecule bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 receptor domain
MDM2-4LWU-ligand-only        -- a nutlin-like small molecule in solution
```
