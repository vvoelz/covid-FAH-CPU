Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Library dir:  /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  gmx grompp -c /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/npt.gro -f /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/prod.mdp -p /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/topol.top -n /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/index.ndx -o ../frame0.tpr -po ../mdout.mdp -maxwarn 1


NOTE 1 [file /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/prod.mdp, line 226]:
  /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/prod.mdp did not specify a value
  for the .mdp option "cutoff-scheme". Probably it was first intended for
  use with GROMACS before 4.6. In 4.6, the Verlet scheme was introduced,
  but the group scheme was still the default. The default is now the Verlet
  scheme, so you will observe different behaviour.

Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'andersen_seed'
Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'optimize_fft'
Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc-precision' by 'compressed-x-precision'

NOTE 2 [file /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/prod.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy


NOTE 3 [file /var/lib/fah-work/projects/p14338/RUN0/prod.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.
